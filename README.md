With a team of three ([DidikeM], [Burak] and [LordWile]), we developed a web-based recycling tracking system where a user is rewarded with our litecoin architecture-based cryptocurrency which named "recyclecoin" for every object they recycled. The system also has a forum where users can have conversations and discuss on various topics. The system has an object detection service which trained with our custom dataset on YOLOv3 algorithm and used as a service in Python. RecycleCoin Project has ASP.NET backend and HTML/CSS frontend. Project's services are connected with gRPC and SOAP.
